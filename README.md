# ShelfWise

ShelfWise is a stock management app built with Deno, TypeScript, and SQLite.

The goal is to create a modern, user-friendly system to replace spreadsheets and manual inventory tracking. Features like product management, real-time stock updates, and user roles are planned.

The project is still in development â€” many features are yet to be implemented.

## Project Structure (Work in Progress)
- **Controllers**: Handle app logic (e.g. authentication, product management)
- **Models**: Communicate with the database
- **Utils**: Helpers for tasks like JWT handling, hashing, etc.
